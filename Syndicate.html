    <p>Welcome, Agent. If you've accessed this briefing, your objectives likely require the precise and lethal
        application of chemical synthesis. This Guide will assist you in creating reagents of disruption, fear,
        and chaos. </p>
    <p>
        <em>Remember: discretion is paramount.</em> These compounds are not to be fabricated without proper
        clearance, that
        is, confirmed antagonist status. Unauthorized use of most of these chemicals risks things such as;
        detainment, demotion, capital punishment, or worse: <strong>CentCom
            intervention</strong> <em>(I.e don't self antag, DUHH)</em>.<br> Operate smart, act with purpose, and never
        forget that at the end of the day:

    <h3>SYNDICATE UPLINK</h3>
    <div class="highlight">████████████████████████████</div>
    <p><em>This section will go through some useful and relevant items that your established uplink can provide you</em>
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header smokes">██ SYNDICATE SMOKES PACKET | 1 TC | PACK OF 10 CIGARETTES INFUSED WITH NICOTINE AND
        OMNIZINE </div>
    <p>
        One cigarette contains 10u of nicotine, and 30u of Omnizine. A cigarette will extinguish the moment the
        amount of contained chemicals run out, due to syndi smokes having far more units compared to normal cigarettes,
        this
        will mean
        that
        it will last far longer than a regular one. A burning cigarette will "metabolize" 0.15u of its contained
        chemical roughly every 3 seconds, due to it being diluted with nicotine, it will provide you with 75% of those
        0.15u
        of Omnizine every 3 seconds, giving you a passive healing of about 0.5 damage of most types every 3 seconds (so
        long
        as you don't metabolize other chemicals at the same time).
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to its cheap TC cost, the amount of cigarettes
        provided and the long passive intake of Omnizine
        means it's a nice alternative to visiting medbay, as it heals all damage types apart from cellular. Don't
        overlook the potential in this purchase.
    </p>
    <p> You can expel all the Omnizine at once into the air by injecting a smoke mix into the cigarette.
        Simply fill one
        syringe with 15u of sugar, and another with 7u of potassium and phosphorus. If you light the cigarette and
        inject them with all three chemicals, the Omnizine will be ingestible in the air, giving you around 20u worth or
        so (depends on how fast you are) in
        one go.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is quite loud, is very visible as it creates a wall of smoke, and can't be done in the vacuum of
        space, however, the amount of Omnizine is
        enough to give you full space immunity for a duration, as the Omnizine outheals any cold, pressure and
        asphyxiation
        damage you may take. Other people can also ingest the smoke, so make sure you either do it alone or have it work
        to your benefit, cooperation can be beneficial for all.
    </p>
    <span class="chem-header chemical-synthesis">██ CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS KIT | 4 TC | PROVIDES VESTINE AND
        HYPERZINE</span>
    <p>This is the bread and butter of any respectable chemist that wants to produce the worst of the worst. One of
        these kits contains
        60u of Vestine (2 vials 30u), a 15u syringe containing Hyperzine, 2 small beakers (50u each), one empty vial
        (30u), one dropper (5u with ability to add or remove 1u at a time), and some chemical analysis
        goggles.</p>

    <p> Due to the amount of things provided this kit can be useful to people that don't have access to a
        chemistry lab, but that still have some access to reagents, such as botanists, cargo technicians or maint
        chemists. The amount of chemicals you can produce with the Vestine provided in one kit will be shown later in
        this guide. </p>
    <p>
        If you are working with this in a lab then this kit should be hidden from any snooping co-worker, as
        it is quite obvious where you got it from.
        Either dump it in disposals or keep it on your persons to decrease the likelihood of getting caught.</p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-nocturine">██ NOCTURINE BOTTLE | 6 TC | 30u OF NOCTURINE, FORCES UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT 8u
    </div>

    <p>Buying nocturine is pricey compared to synthesising it yourself, you get 5u of nocturine per 1 TC if you buy one
        bottle (contains 30u). If you decide to buy a synthesis
        kit you can fabricate 60u worth of nocturine for 4
        TC, which would would be 15u per 1 TC (that's a 200% efficiency in TC use!). If you're able to synthesise it you
        can
        therefore produce twice as many units
        and save more of your TC.
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header dart">██ HYPO DART | 2 TC | 7u OF INSTANTLY INJECTABLE CHEMICALS, RANGE WEAPON</div>
    <p>Will provide you with a disintegrating case with an inconspicuous dart inside. This dart can hold up to 7u worth
        of
        any
        chemical, and can instantly inject someone with it if thrown. It will also inject 1u worth of chemicals if used
        as a stabbing weapon (not very effective as a weapon that way).
    </p>

    <p>
        The dart can either be paired up with highly lethal chemicals such as Lexorin in order to deal a nasty blow
        fast, or in tandem with several darts in order to deliver any kind of mixture that you please. The only downside
        being that it is thrown, which can mean that effectiveness depends on your ability to hit your target in the
        first place.
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header hypoPen">██ HYPOPEN | 6 TC | 10u OF INSTANTLY INJECTABLE CHEMICALS, APPLIES 5u EACH PRESS
    </div>
    <p>The hypopen is quite costly but an excellent tool for most scenarios. It gives you the choice of injecting
        yourself or others in quick rapid 5u intervals. Due to it having a 10u capacity, compared to the CMO's 30u
        hypospray, it is advised to carry jugs, bottles or vials on you for easy refills, depending on your
        goals. You can also easily hide this pen in your PDA, making it great for stealth. It does however produce an
        audible noise and people injected will be able to notice if they are paying attention, so use it with caution.
    </p>
    <p>Fill
        it with Nocturine to easily knock someone out or use it to deliver lethal doses in seconds. You can also inject
        yourself with things like Hyperzine, Desoxyphedrine,
        Epinephrine (which gives you adrenaline and a speed boost) or any other medical chems to heal yourself in a
        pinch.</p>

    <p>
        <mark>Bonus tips:</mark> If you right click on a person you can interact with their sprite when you hold the
        hypopen, meaning they can be easily injected even whilst moving. You can also press the use button (normally set
        to
        Z) to instantly inject yourself.
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header combatMedipen">██ COMBAT MEDIPEN | 4 TC | OMNI HEALING INJECTOR </div>
    <p>A quite self-explanatory purchase, the Combat Medipen contains 25u of Omnizine and 5u of Tranexamic acid in a one
        use instant auto-injector. This
        can be useful for usage mid combat or right after, as the Omnizine will heal most damage and the Tranexamic acid
        will stop or slow most bleeding. Contains more units than that of a regular emergency pen, which contains 12u of
        Epinephrine and 3u of Tranexamic acid. </p>

    <div class="chem-header combatMedkit">██ COMBAT MEDKIT | 5 TC | MISC HEALING SUPPLIES </div>
    <p>This medkit which takes up a 2x2 slot in any inventory contains a wide assortment of general purpose healing
        supplies. It
        contains one Brute auto-injector (15u Bicaridine, 5u Tranexamic acid), one Burn auto-injector (10u Dermaline,
        10u
        Leporazine), a 15u Ephedrine syringe, a
        15u Saline syringe, 10 Sutures
        and 10 Regenerative meshes.</p>
    <p> It can therefore heal most forms of burn damage, apart from caustic, and all forms
        of
        brute. It can even heal some levels of bloodloss with the Saline, and the Ephedrine can be a good pre combat
        stimulant or treatment to an ally that's crit. Be aware though that the Brute auto-injector will give you 1.5
        poison damage as it's on the verge of the OD value. The Burn injector does similarly briefly OD you but this
        damage will be healed instantly and is therefore negligible.</p>

    <div class="chem-header hyperzineInjector chem-hyper">██ HYPERZINE INJECTOR | 4 TC | 30u OF HYPERZINE </div>
    <p>One injector with 30u of Hyperzine in it. A synthesis kit costs the same amount of TC, 4, and is able to
        synthesise 4
        times the amount as provided here, i.e
        120u. A synthesis kit also grants you a syringe's worth of 15u, for a total of 135u of Hyperzine. The main
        difference here being
        that the injector allows for a quick instant injection,
        compared to the slower ingestion or injection you would get by buying a kit and needing to either ingest it in
        pill
        form, drink it, using a syringe or spending even more TC on a hypopen/dart. </p>

    <div class="chem-header hyperzineInjectorKit chem-hyper">██ HYPERZINE INJECTOR KIT | 12 TC | 6 INJECTORS WITH 15u
        HYPERZINE
        EACH</div>
    <p>This gives you one standard medical kit that takes up a 2x4 space in your bag containing 6 small injectors that
        carry 15u of Hyperzine each. The cost of buying a kit vs synthesising is (1:4), you
        get 90u for 12 TC with this kit, but buying 3 synthesis kits for the same price you'd be able to make 360u of
        Hyperzine (ontop of the 60u that comes from the syringes in the kits).</p>
    <p>The main advantage of this kit is getting access to them instantly ontop of them being
        instant injectors. You
        could however recreate this effect by buying a synthesis kit and a Hypopen for 12 TC, then you'd be able to make
        120u (+15u from syringe) AND have instant injections. Only buy this kit if you're cooperating with other agents
        and need to spread
        around the injectors amongst yourselves or if it's on a discount, as it wastes 4 times the amount of TC compared
        to synthesis.
    </p>
    <h3>TOXINS</h3>
    <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>
    <p>The format for this section will show the name of the toxin, the damage type of the toxin, the damage
        per second followed by
        damage per unit, and finally an approximate amount of needed units and time it takes to crit someone. Toxins
        each
        have a
        set amount of units digested per
        second, meaning that you want the most amount of units digested per second, and the highest damage per that
        unit to in theory maximize the amount of lethality. The amount of units it takes to crit someone are
        not to be taken as pure fact however, as there are lots of different factors that go into damaging a target.
        This can depend on what
        species they are, which can affect metabolism, if they were already injured, if they inject themselves with a
        medi pen,
        etc.</p>

    <p>Do also make sure to remember the type of damage you are dealing to your target; bloodloss passively
        heals over time if they have a high enough percentage of blood, and airloss gets healed if they aren't in crit
        and have a
        steady supply of breathable air, which means that you might need to use more units than what is shown in this
        guide. The body can also passively heal things like brute damage in small quantities and someone afflicted with
        bleeding will eventually stop after a time, even without cauterization or topicals like gauze.
    </p>
    <p>You also need to keep in mind the difficulty or ease of
        revival a doctor may have with a dead target. It is way easier to revive someone who died from airloss
        (defib heals 40
        damage but deals 5 shock) or other forms of damage that can be healed with topicals. Things like cellular,
        radiation or poison
        don't have topicals, so if you deal enough damage of these types then a person may become (hypothetically)
        unrevivable.
        A poisoned corpse can be healed by using Necrosol, though it's VERY hard to get access to, requiring Omnizine.
        Someone that goes into crit will also passively take asphyxiation damage, which can counteract any other damage
        type, making it more feasible to revive them. Say your target is dying of poison but takes 10 damage of
        asphyxiation as they're laying in crit, giving them 190 poison damage and 10 asphyxiation damage. A
        doctor could feasibly inject the corpse with poison and asphyxiation medicine (for example Epinephrine),
        revive them (putting them at 190 poison damage, and 5 shock damage), heal the shock with a topical, and just
        barely keep them alive for long
        enough to have them metabolize some poison medicine. With careful supervision the seemingly unrevivable target
        could be brought back, which might be a thorn in your side.</p>

    <p>The <mark>(V)</mark> Indicates that the recipe requires Vestine, and therefore will be requiring you to spend
        at least 4 TC for the synthesis kit. It will also show you the maximum amount that you can make with 60u, which
        comes in one synthesis kit, and the "preferred amount", i.e roughly the least amount necessary for it to take
        effect or crit your
        target
        guaranteed.</p>
    <span class="chem-header toxins chem-lexorin">██ LEXORIN <mark>(V)</mark> | AIRLOSS & BLOODLOSS | 10 DMG/s & 20

    </p>
    <p>
        <mark>Bonus tip:</mark> 5u Lexorin and 5u Heartbreaker kills in 6-7
        seconds with a hypopen (Most can metabolize two reagents at the same time, meaning that you should mix
        something with Lexorin to maximise damage. Slimes could get killed faster due to more metabolizing
        capabilities). Combo with 15 units of Nocturine first for an unavoidable guaranteed crit. 10u of Noct allows the
        target to potentially get up
        briefly before going into crit if they try to wake themselves up. The problem with a Noct + Lexorin +
        Heartbreaker mix is they will
        metabolize the Nocturine first, which will slow down the average time to kill, but it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to
        fight back if you use this method.
    </p>

    <p><mark>
            Due to this needing Lead this recipe is currently only consistently accessible
            to Nuclear Operatives that cut the MNGR wire on their
            syndieJuice machines. This gives them: 3 30u Pax bottles, 3 30u Mute toxin bottles, 2 30u Lead bottles, and
            1 30u Toxin bottle.
            The
            60u of Lead means that's the
            maximum amount of Tazinide synthesizable
            for
            one
            team. Zinc can only be obtained from grinding power cells (5u zinc each) which can be found in flashlights
            at your outpost or brass sheets (3.3u zinc
            each) which can be taken from the ATS or cargo. Lead can also be found in maint pills, which can be acquired
            by either maint diving or by cutting the
            MNGR wire in your ChemVend, though these pills can also contain a very random amount of chemicals.

        <strong>Super illegal method: </strong> Add 60 lead, 60 zinc, 60 Vestine to a jug to make 60 tazinide<br>
        <strong>Still illegal but more normal method:</strong> Mix in a beaker [50 lead + 50 zinc], add 50 Vestine then
        store in ChemMaster. Repeat
        with 10 units each for the rest. <br>
        <strong>Most reasonable method:</strong> Make it through botany. Mutated crops have a small chance of containing
        Licoxide, which could then be combined with Vestine to create Tazinide. This is far more accessible to
        operatives that have access to hydroponics on the station, and will most likely not be done by Nuclear
        Operatives.

        Lead
        is tasteless and can therefore be used to spike water or meals without anyone being able to tell. Is also

    <h3>OFFENSIVE CHEMICALS</h3>
    <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>
    <p><strong>This section is more for general usage but I'll try to give some tips and talk a bit
            more in depth on how they can be used for you to achieve your goals.</strong></p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-powa">██ POTASSIUM WATER MIX | EXPLOSIVE | NA</div>
    <p>Simple but effective. Mix equal parts Potassium and Water to create an explosion. This could be done by storing
        it
        in a cryostasis beaker, or by combining two chemical payloads in a modular grenade. You could also toss two
        separate jugs or beakers with Water and Potassium to create a DIY grenade, make sure to aim well however, and to
        NOT slip with them in your hands for <mark>unsolicited</mark> consequences.
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-clf3">██ CHLORINE TRIFLUORIDE | EXPLOSIVE | NA</div>
    <p>
        CLF3 gets created and explodes when Chlorine and Fluorine reaches a hot enough temperature. CLF3 is harder to
        detonate than a Potassium Water bomb,
        but you get more boom out of units used, and is therefore "better", but harder to achieve practically.<br>
        Here's a simple solution mix that creates easy
        to make and toss Potassium CLF3 bombs in either small bottles or in one big beaker.
    </p>
    <p>[8(4) water + 6(3) hydr + 2(1) nitr] + [15 chlo + 45 fluo + 15 pota] <br>
        This will be enough for one beakers worth. Results of this bomb are highly unreliable and can sometimes deal
        high or
        low amounts of damage. This is the tradeoff of how easy it is to make however. You can also dilute this mixture
        into three smaller bottles. <mark>Try not to trip whilst carrying these as well...</mark>
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-flash">██ CHEMICAL FLASH | EYE HURTY OW I CAN'T SEE | NA</div>
    <p>Mixing equal parts Aluminum, Potassium and Sulfur creates a brief flash, similar to those that security may use.
        This could have some uses, as it can disorient and briefly stun some targets, however this will be ineffective
        towards security, as they possess flash protective goggles. Wearing things like a welding mask will
        protect you from your own flash. Can be good for getting the drop on an unsuspecting target.</p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-emp">██ CHEMICAL EMP | EMP EXPLOSION | DRAINS ENERGY OF NEARBY POWER SOURCES</div>
    <p>Mixing equal parts Iron, Uranium and Aluminum will cause an EMP explosion that drains power from nearby sources.
        These include APCs, power stations, stunbatons, lights, doors, borgs, anything that uses power. This can be
        extremely useful in many scenarios and will make it easier for you to get in or out of a situation if needed.
        You can obtain Uranium by grinding most things that are made of Uranium, including cancer mice (though getting
        it
        from other sources like engineering or cargo is usually easier).
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-smoke">██ SMOKE | SMOKE <em>cough</em> | NA</div>
    <p>Equal parts Phosphorus, Potassium and Sugar when mixed creates a smoke cloud that blocks vision, also carries
        chemicals
        into the air, making them ingestible to those without internals on. Good for lethal mixes and for those that
        want to escape in a puff of smoke. Create Norepinephric acid by mixing equal parts Uranium and Epinephrine to
        create a chemical that causes blindness when over 20u
        are ingested for a really powerful smoke screen.</p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-fluorosurf">██ FLUOROSURFACTANT | FOAM | NA</div>
    <p>Creates foam when mixed with water that has the ability to carry chemicals. Is ingestible to those that don't
        have internals on.<br>[5(1) hydr + 5(1) sulf + 10(2)
        oxyg] + [30(2) carb + 30(2) fluo] x2
    </p>
    <p>
        This is one of the most efficient and lethal ways of administering chemicals to a target or targets. The
        right mixture can be unbelievably lethal, and gives your target almost no time to react if they don't have
        internals on. The slipping effect caused by this also increases their time spent in the foam, making things
        worse for them. Try to mix equal parts Water and Fluoro, as excess amount wastes space in the container.</p>

    <p>
        You can either mix
        things in a jug or a beaker if you want to get close to the target, or in two chemical payloads and a modular
        grenade if you want some range. If you do use a jug/beaker make sure to have internals on, and to know if your
        own mix will hurt you based on skin contact. Razorium and some acids are able to damage you even without
        being ingested, though not as much. The amount of units you mix in with the Fluorosurfactant will be slightly
        less when ingested, so make sure to use more than what might be necessary to crit a target.
    </p>

    <div class="chem-header chem-lube">██ SPACE LUBE | SLIPS, ALWAYS | NA</div>
    <p>
        Good for tossing behind you whilst running away from sec or anyone that you pissed off. Make sure you have no
        slip shoes or something similar to not slip yourself.<br>
        [20(2) water + 20(2) oxyg + 10(1) iron + 10(1) silicon] x2<br>▬ heat until fully mixed ▬</p>

    <div class="chem-header  chem-glue">██ SPACE GLUE | STICKS, ALWAYS | NA</div>
    <p>[10(2) water + 10(2) oxyg + 5(1) iron + 5(1) silicon] + [50(1) slime] x2<br>▬ heat until fully mixed ▬ <br>
        You can get slime from grinding any sort of cockroach, slimeball or slime sack, or by drawing from a slime,
        preferably by taking it from their corpse if they do not comply.</p>
