  <h1>Tom's & <mark>Caesar's</mark> Guide to Chemistry</h1>
  <h2>Volume four: Extra</h2>
  <div class="line">▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬</div>

  <p>Hello! This volume contains some information that wouldn't fit in the other three, but that I wanted to write down
    anyway because I think it's useful information. We'll cover how to make topicals (basic and advanced) and we'll
    cover some more chemicals that <em>are not medicine <mark>- don't worry Tom, I know plenty about that
        hehe...</mark></em></p>

  <h3>BASIC TOPICALS</h3>
  <div class="highlight">████████████████████████████</div>
  <span class="chem-header basic-topical chem-bruise">██ BRUISE PACKS | BRUTE | MEDICAL TECHFAB</span>

  <p>0.25 plastic, 0.25 steel ea.<br>2.5 plastic, 2.5 steel = stack of 10</p>

  <div class="chem-header basic-topical chem-ointment">██ OINTMENT | BURNS | MEDICAL TECHFAB</div>

  <div class="chem-header basic-topical chem-aloe">██ ALOE CREAM | BURNS | MICROWAVE</div>
  <p>Microwave 1 aloe leaf for 10 seconds.<br>Produces 10 aloe cream.</p>

  <h3>ADVANCED TOPICALS</h3>
  <p><mark>I tried my best to have the chems for the topicals use as little waste as possible, but it's very difficult
      with these specific recipes, so proportions are unavailable for some recipes.
    </mark></p>
  <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>
  <span class="chem-header advanced-topical chem-suture">██ MEDICATED SUTURES | BRUTE/BLEEDING | MICROWAVE</span>
  <ul>
    <li>2 Poppy</li>
    <li>2 Bruise Pack</li>
    <li>2 Cloth</li>
  </ul>
  One beaker with: [[5(1) hydr + 5(1) sulf + 10(2) oxy] + [5 oxy + 5 carb + 5 sugar] + 15 suga] + [15 oxyg + 15
  pota + 15 suga]

  <p>Microwave it all for 20 seconds.<br>Produces 20 Medicated Sutures.</p>

  <div class="chem-header advanced-topical chem-mesh">██ REGENERATIVE MESH | BURNS | MICROWAVE</div>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Aloe</li>
    <li>1 Ointment</li>
    <li>1 Cloth</li>
  </ul>
  Step 1. [2 chlo + 2 sodi], heat. Add [3 hydr + 1 nitr + 4 carb + 4 oxyg + 4 suga], store in ChemMaster<br>
  Step 2. [2 oxyg + 2 hydr + 4 sodi + 5 carb + 5 sili + 5 suga], heat then store in ChemMaster<br>
  Step 3. From storage, mix: 5u each sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sugar, kelotane. Add 5 water and
  heat.<br>
  Step 4. Add [[4 sili + 4 carb] + 7 oxyg + 7 phos]

  <p>Microwave it all for 10 seconds.<br>Produces 10 Regenerative Mesh.</p>

  <h3><mark>FUNNY CHEMICALS</mark></h3>
  <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>

  <span class="chem-header chem-cogni">██ COGNIZINE | COGNITION | CREATES SENTIENCE WITH 5u</span>
  <p>
    <mark>One step of this recipe is enough to create 30 units of cogni, enough for 6 things to become cognizant, we
      don't need more than that right? right???</mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    Step 1. [20(4) welding fuel + 5(1) hydrogen + 5(1) carbon + 15(3) oxygen]<br>
    Step 2. Mix [15 aloe + 15 stellibinin]<br>
    Step 3. Mix [30 siderlac + 30 acetone + 30 carpotoxin]<br>
    Step 4. repeat all steps 6 times for full jug <em><mark>(WHY DO YOU NEED SO MUCH COGNITION OH GOD)</mark></em>
  </p>

  <span class="chem-header chem-corgi">██ CORGIUM | CORGI | MAKES METABOLIZER A CORGI AT 50u, DEALS CELLULAR
    DAMAGE</span>
  <p>
    <mark>A minimum of 50u is needed to transform into a corgi, if one lizard plushie is grinded it'll create 60u of
      corgium in
      total, enough for some to spare, or if you want you can make a corgi smoke/foam-bomb for multiple people to
      inhale.
      Due to the strange nature of this
      product you will need to source materials from a couple of places not in chem. Items can also be substituted
      (mainly acquiring uncooked animal protein), but as a general shopping list you'll need:
    </mark>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 lizard plushie
    </li>
    <li>
      4 raw meat
    </li>
    <li>
      1 banana
    </li>
    <li>
      8u epinephrine, spare yourself the trouble and get a bottle from a NanoMed Plus
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Step 1. Juice any lizard plushie in grinder and a banana, store in ChemMaster<br>
    Step 2. Grind enough meat/small creatures until you have atleast 30u of uncooked animal protiens, store in
    ChemMaster<br>
    Step 3. Mix: [8 banana juice + 8 sugar + 8 epinephrine + 8 ethanol +
    1 CAT plasma +
    30 animal proteins + 30 weh juice]<br>
    Step 4. Remove excess chemicals, and enjoy your new fluffy life, arf :3<br>
    Step 5. repeat all steps 3 times for full jug
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wanna share the fluffiness, have 60u of corgium in a beaker, then add [4(2) oxyg +
    2(1) sulf + 2(1) hydr] + [8(2)carb + 8(2) fluo], remove the 2u of sulf acid, then add 20u of water when bunched up.
  </p>

  <p><mark>Keep in mind that these following chemicals are illegal, so maybe don't flaunt them around TOO much, even if
      it's not the end of the world if you do so. Most people (including heads and sec) don't give a shit, but if you're
      told off they have every right to confiscate it from you etc etc. <em>Just be sneaky about it instead
        hehe</em></mark>
  </p>

  <span class="chem-header chem-desox">██ DESOXYDEPHEDRINE | METH | DEALS MINOR POISON BUT OD'S AT 30u</span>
  <p>
    Step 1. [10 welding fuel + 10 carb + 10 hydr] + [15(3) hydr + 5(1) nitr + 20(4) etha],
    store in ChemMaster<br>
    Step 2. Remove 5 oil + 15 Diethylamine (25u of each in beaker) using ChemMaster<br>
    Step 3. Add [25 hydr + 25 suga], store in ChemMaster<br>
    Step 4. Remove 75 Ephedrine using ChemMaster<br>
    Step 5. Add [25 carb + 25 iodi + 25 phos] and heat<br>
    Step 6. Repeat from step 5 with 25 Ephedrine<br>
    <em>Mix equal parts dylo (sili + nitro + potas) and desox in ChemMaster for safer pills</em>

  <div class="chem-header toxins chem-space">██ SPACE MIRAGE | HALLUCINATIONS | ONLY PERCEPTIVE DAMAGE</div>
  <p>[30 mercury + 30 sugar + 30 lithium] x2</p>

  <h3>USEFUL MISCELLANEOUS CHEMICALS</h3>
  <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>

  <p><mark>These chemicals (and materials) can be useful in some situations, they're by no means necessary and often
      times more something to
      either make based off of a request or if you have spare time to kill.</mark></p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-plastic">██ PLASTIC | 10 SHEETS | THE ENVIRONMENT</div>
  <p> <mark>Usefull for when you need to fabricate extra things in the medical techfab (like jugs, body bags, combat
      medkits,
      etc), or if cargo isn't running and people
      need it for whatever reason. Firstly you'll need 30u of ash, one piece of paper that's burned gives 10u if scooped
      up (tip, your pda can print out infinite NanoTask items). </mark></p>
  <p>
    Step 1. [14(2) oxyg + 7(1) sulf + 7(1) hydr], store in ChemMaster <br>
    Step 2. Make sure beaker is cool then add: [17 welding fuel + 17 hydr + 17 carb], store
    in ChemMaster <br>
    Step 3. In ChemMaster mix [50(5) oil + 30(3) ash + 20(2) sulf. acid], heat until mixed
  </p>



  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-soap">██ SOAP | SOAPS, ALWAYS</div>
  <p>Fat can be gained from grinding various
    meats or centrifuging oil (equal parts: welding fuel, hydrogen, carbon) <br>
    Heat a beaker with: [10 chlorine + 10 sodium], then add [20(1) blood + 30(1.5) fat], creates two bars of soap.
  </p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-lube">██ SPACE LUBE | SLIPS, ALWAYS </div>
  <p>[20(2) water + 20(2) oxyg + 10(1) iron + 10(1) silicon], heat x2</p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-glue">██ SPACE GLUE | STICKS, ALWAYS</div>
  <p>[10(2) water + 10(2) oxyg + 5(1) iron + 5(1) silicon] + [50(1) slime], heat x2
    <br> You can get slime from grinding any sort of cockroach, slimeball or slime sack, or by drawing from a slime,
    preferably by asking them first.
  </p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-cleaner">██ SPACE CLEANER | CLEANS, ALWAYS </div>
  <p>[30(3) hydr + 10(1) nitr + 40(1) water] x2 <br>Good for mixing with Fluorosurfactant to spread it out like a
    regular Clenade. Feel free to ask science for chemical payloads if you want to make a proper modular grenade. Try
    this
    recipe in a large beaker for a DIY handheld Clenade:<br>
    [15(3) hydr + 5(1) nitr + 20(1) water] + [2(1) hydr + 2(1) sulf + 4(2) oxyg] + [12(2) carb + 12(2) fluo] , add 30
    water to clean!
  </p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-fluorosurf">██ FLUOROSURFACTANT | FOAM | CARRIES OTHER CHEMS IN SAME MIX
  </div>
  <p>Creates foam with water that carries chemicals, always mix equal parts fluoro and water for highest
    coverage. Try to mix things that don't have an OD if you want to make for example healing bombs, like Trico, Saline,
    Ambuzol, Omnizine, Inaprovaline etc. Best is to mix in a jug or chemical payload for maximum amount of coverage and
    dosage, so take for example 50 fluoro, 50
    water and 100u of your medicine, REMEMBER TO MIX ALL THE WATER/FLUORO LAST AS IT INSTANTLY TURNS TO FOAM. <mark>Also
      don't get any dumb ideas filling this with non medicine... <em>atleast not yet...</em></mark><br>[10(2) oxyg +
    5(1) sulf + 5(1) hydr] + [30(2)
    carb + 30(2) fluo]
    x2</p>

  <h3>DEFENSE CHEMICALS</h3>
  <div class="highlight">███████████████████████</div>

  <p>Occasionally as a chemist you may be called upon to defend your station. As such, you are permitted to produce
    poisons, pyrotechnics, narcotics, etc. during these scenarios. <strong>This is a responsibility that you must take
      seriously. You will bring a great shame upon the name of the Chemist if you abuse your powers and your
      responsibility.<mark> Come on Tom, people will ALWAYS complain about the Chemist making things they shouldn't,
        just embrace the reputation at this point, besides, this extras page isn't the only place we can make fun
        chemicals...</mark></strong></p>

  <p><strong>This section has different notation from other volumes.</strong>
  </p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-sulfuric">██ SULFURIC ACID | CAUSTIC | 1.666</div>
  <p>[50 oxyg + 25 hydr + 25 sulfur] x2</p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-clf3">██ CHLORINE TRIFLUORIDE | EXPLOSIVE | NA</div>
  <p>[75(3) fluo + 25(1) chlo] x2<br>Explodes when heated above 370K. <br><mark>So make sure NOT to heat them whilst
      it's
      mixed, heat separately and combine in either a cryo stasis beaker or by two separate chemical payloads in a
      modular grenade. <br><strong>GRENADES WOULD BE CONSIDERED CONTRABAND IN MOST SITUATIONS</strong></mark></p>

  <div class="chem-header defense-chem chem-fluorosulfuric">██ FLUOROSULFURIC ACID | CAUSTIC | 2.666</div>
  <p>[25 fluo + 25 hydr + 25 pota + 25 sulfuric acid] x2</p>
