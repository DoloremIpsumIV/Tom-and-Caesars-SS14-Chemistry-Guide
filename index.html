    <p>Congratulations, by reading this informative Guide you are well on your way to being an adequate chemist!</p>

    <p>This Guide comes in <del>four</del> <em><mark>(5)</mark></em> different volumes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1: Basics</strong> - Covers basic chemistry practice, and the common chems you need.</li>
        <li><strong>2: Advanced</strong> - Covers more advanced chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>3: Cheat sheet</strong> - A sheet containing the recipes for almost all the chems you will ever need
            to produce.</li>
        <li><strong>4: Extra</strong> - Recipes for topicals, <mark>and some other fun stuff.</mark></li>

    <p><em>First things first:</em><br>
        When there are multiple chemists, it is important that they act as a team. Chemists must communicate with each
        other, and they may occasionally need to share resources or even equipment. You should do your utmost to ensure
        cooperation within your team.</p>

    <p>Now, the first things a chemist team needs when the shift starts is to make the basic medicines that any medbay
        needs, <del>and to acquire plasma for some of the more advanced medicines. Plasma can usually be acquired from
            either
            science or cargo, and if they only offer you a little, that's fine. Usually you don't need a lot, and it's
            crucial not to waste time at the start of a shift when you could be making medicine.</del> <mark>You should
            find some plasma in your chem locker at the start of the shift, thanks NT!</mark></p>

    <p>You may have people coming up to your window to request chemicals, such as botanists, janitors, clowns, and
        psychologists. You are obliged to fulfill their requests, but only once you have fulfilled the needs of the
        medbay. <strong>Remember: your first duty is to make medicine, not Space cleaner, Robust harvest <mark>or the
                <em>funny chems™</em></mark></strong></p>

    <p>Usually as a chemist you will make medicines and put them in jugs, which you should label with a medicine's name,
        use, and overdosage quantity. All of the information regarding a chemical, such as its usage and OD can be found
        in your Guidebook, which all NT employees should have at all times. <mark>Also if you run out of jugs you can
            always dump chems into your ChemMaster and simply rename the empty jugs, some chemists keep ALL their chems
            in the ChemMaster, but that's only crazy people... (do what you find most comfortable)</mark></p>

    <p>This Guide is written assuming you have an understanding of the chemistry machinery and how to use it. If you do
        not, please refer <a href="https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Chemist">to the Wiki here.</a><br>
    </p>

    <p><mark>Also before we fully delve into things, I <em>Caesar</em> have taken Tom's Guide and "remastered" it into a
            web format, <a href="https://github.com/Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt/tree/master/Guides/Chemistry">the original
                is
                here</a>, and most (basically all) credit should go to their work. I've simply added some recipes,
            changed things to be a bit more up to date and to add some extra fun things that is only possible on a
            website. Frankly I'm no genius chemist but I'm 99% sure every recipie works, it's worked from my testing at
            least. Worst
            case just check the Wiki or ingame textbook and you'll be fine :p. Also <strong>thank you again Tom for this
                Guide,
                it's SO
                FUCKING USEFUL oh my god I love it, PLEASE MAKE THE FREZON GUIDE if not I'll be forced to use my 4
                braincells and learn atmos (blegh)...</strong> <br>Anyways enjoy the read and have fun with the funny
            yucky floor
            meds!</mark></p>

    <h3>BASIC MEDICINES</h3>
    <div class="highlight">██████████████████████████</div>
    <p>How to read this section:<br>
        Each entry will contain a chemical's name, usage (usually what damage it treats), overdose amount (N/A if there
        is none) followed by the recipe to create about one full jug of it. <mark>One jug can contain 200u worth, and
            all recipies use large beakers (100u) for mixing. Your locker should contain atleast two, which means you
            can share! </mark></p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-dylo">██ DYLOVENE | POISON | 20u</span>
    <p>[30 silicon + 30 nitrogen + 30 potassium] x2</p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-bicar">██ BICARIDINE | BRUTE | 15u</span>
    <p>[[15 oxygen + 15 sugar + 15 carbon] + 45 carbon] x2</p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-derma">██ DERMALINE | BURNS | 10u</span>
    <p>[[15 silicon + 15 carbon] + 30 oxygen + 30 phosphorus] x2</p>

    <p>Dermaline, Bicaridine, and Dylovene are the most basic chemicals to make first in the shift, as those three can
        treat the majority of patients. <mark>Keep in mind that Dermaline won't treat every type of heat damage compared
            to ointment, which will treat ALL heat damage. It
            treats BURNS, not things like caustic damage. Bicaridine is good for all brute damage but it doesn't heal
            as much or as fast as the advanced brutes, like say Lacerol. Try to keep that in mind when making other
            meds, check the guidebook if you're uncertain, as it describes exactly what damage it heals, this guide
            simplifies the damage type at times.</mark></p>

    <p>Some chemicals use other chemicals as precursors, for instance Arithrazine uses Hyronaline which uses Dylovene.
        You can create common precursors separately and store them in your ChemMaster, or you can create them "inline"
        in your dispenser. Both are acceptable, the latter is usually a little faster if you are good at it, but is
        harder.</p>

    <p>If a recipe calls for more space than you have in your beaker, you can use a jug instead, or you can use your
        ChemMaster to make more space. <mark>Arithrazine is one of these meds, just dump all the shit into one jug and
            it'll mix up nicely.</mark></p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-arith">██ ARITHRAZINE | RADIATION | No OD, but it does deal BRUTE damage
        gradually</span>
    <p>[15 silicon + 15 potassium + 15 nitrogen + 45 radium] + 90 hydrogen</p>

    <p>Some chemicals use other chemicals as a catalyst, meaning that said chemical is not consumed in the reaction.
        Most medicines with plasma are an example of this. These chemicals will be labeled with CAT. <mark>Remember to
            always
            remove the catalyst with your ChemMaster before pouring it into a jug, no one wants their meds
            spiked.</mark>
    </p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-dex">██ DEXALIN | AIRLOSS | 20u</span>
    <p>[CAT 1 plasma + 60 oxygen] x2</p>

    <p>Some chemicals have conditions to their healing. Tricordrazine will only heal if a patient's total damage is
        below 50, but it will heal all the basic damage types. Try to communicate this kind of info concisely in your
        labels. <mark>It specifically heals a small amount of: Brutes, Poision, Heat, Shock and Cold. These can be
            shortened to "basic" as long jug labels are annoying/hard to read. Use reason when labelling, simpler is
            better.</mark></p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-tricor">██ TRICORDRAZINE | BASIC DAMAGE | Heals all basic damage when under
        50</span>
    <p>[[30 carbon + 30 oxygen + 30 sugar] + [30 silicon + 30 potassium + 30 nitrogen]]</p>

    <span class="chem-header chem-inaprov">██ INAPROVALINE | ASPHYXIATION | No OD, but only works when in critical
        condition</span>
    <p>[30 oxygen + 30 carbon + 30 sugar] x2</p>

    <p>Those are all the most important basic chemicals.<br>
        Congratulations if you have made it to this point of the Guide, you are already more competent than many
        chemists are! Read on to the next volume to learn more, and you can always refer to the <a
            href="Volume three.html">Cheat sheet</a> if you simply
        want a quick reference for recipes. <mark>I'd say Dexalin+ is just straight up better than Dexalin, so no need
            to store it in jugs, just make it for the Dex+ recipie.
            I'm keeping it in however for Tom's demonstration, and every chem has it's own use in certain scenarios, even the simple ones.</mark></p>
